# bazel_sandbox
Sandbox for testing bazel features

# Instructions
1. Download the repository.
2. Build the `test:test` target
3. Make it so the bazel artifacts aren't checked into the git repository.
4. Fix the compilation error by configuring the toolchain to not throw this error for any bazel target.
5. If time permits, setup a linter so that code in this repository is easily formatted with a bash shell script invocation.
