# bazel_sandbox
Sandbox for testing bazel features

# Instructions
1. Download the repository.
2. Build the `test:test` target
3. Make it so the bazel artifacts aren't checked into the git repository.
4. Fix the compilation error without modifying the code. Ideally, make it so no one runs into this compilation error again.
5. If time permits, setup a linter so that code in this repository is easily formatted with a bash shell script invocation.
